I found a dataset that kept track of how many times certain illness has been mentioned by the media. I used OpenRefine to get rid of the columns I do not need and then moved it to excel where I filtered each columns to answer my questions. The three questions I "asked" to the dataset are:


Q1) What are the most mentioned diseases?
A1) The top eight are: COVID, SARS, HIV/AIDS, MERS, Ebola, H1N1, Malaria, Pneumonia in that order.

Q2) Does the frequency of being mentioned by the media have any correlation with the fatality rate?
A2) The top six are: echinococcosis, Ebola, MERS, Tuberculosis, Meningitis, SARS. Seems like there aren't any direct correlation between the two. COVID is out of the question because the fatality rate isn't clear yet.

Q3) Does the frequency of being mentioned by the media have any correlation with the number of average deaths per day/annual global fatalities?
A3) The top seven for both categories are: tuberculosis, hepatitis B, Pneumonia, HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Shigellosis. Seems like there aren't any direct correlation between the two.


The sample headline and nutgraf could be something like:


Is media hyping up the danger of coronavirus? It might be

The data collected by an infographics database Information is Beautiful shows that there is no correlation between the frequency of a certain illness being mentioned by the media and fatality rate/infectious rate/average number of deaths per day/annual global fatalities. Also, COVID-19, which is the most mentioned illness until now, does not lead in infectious rate, average number of deaths per day and annual global fatalities so the claim that the media is hyping up the danger of coronavirus is not completely baseless.
