I would like to build a map that colour codes states (or counties - I haven't decided it yet) to indicate where they are in the reopening process. Typically, the reopening process is divided in three phases and each state/county set up their own timelines on when to enter which phase. For instance, Georgia already started their phase 1 on April 24th while Virginia announced today that the state will extend its widespread shutdown until May 14th and then decide whether to move on.

The wave to reopen began just now and this is what people really want to know so I figured it would be timely to bundle the timelines onto a single map. CNN has an interactive post that has a drop-down menu of each state so that the reader can find the state of his or her interest and see what the plan is like in that state. I thought it would be a good idea to visualize it so that people can see the trend altogether and make it easier for them to navigate through states.

The data I need can be found on big media websites like CNN and the firsthand data can be collected from press releases of eachs state/governor's office. I can also talk to people who work for the state/governor to clarify the plans or basically to ask any questions that could come up in the way.

Also - I think doing a comprehensive map of the US with state breakdowns could look cool but if I figure that's too much work and not finishable the I might just do a map of DMV area with county breakdowns.
