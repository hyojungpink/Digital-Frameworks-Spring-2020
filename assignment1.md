<h1> Idea 1: Is stay-at-home order effective? </h1>
<h4> This will be a story mainly building around a data piece. I would like to do a map timeline (like with a slider at the bottom indicating time) and compile two sets of separate data:

* the number of confirmed coronavirus cases per state/city
* dates when each state/city's stay-at-home order became effective

I was thinking maybe I could make the state borders on the map bold when it started the order and the number of confirmed cases would be colourcoded. This way I can show if the numbers are going down/up/staying the same with or without stay-at-home orders in a single map. </h4>

[Stories tracking confirmed cases can be easily found but I went the classic NYT route:]  (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)

Objective: Clarity and accuracy
* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. 

    __I’d say 4 because it clearly shows which states have the most cases and it also shows exact numbers when I hover over the dots on the map__

* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent 

    __It is rather intuitive to navigate so I’d give a 5. The cursor automatically turns into the hand shape the moment I hover near the map so I know the page is allowing me to click on stuffs__

* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate 

    __The data is only as accurate as its source and it says the data is from state and local health agencies and hospitals so I hope it is accurate, at least a 4.5__


Objective: Quality
* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.) 

    __This is a 3 from me for the reason I’m addressing in the next question__

* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate) 

    __To be honest I think NYT didn’t really pay much attention to the presentation of the map because especially in NY/NJ area so many dots are overlapping which shows how bad the situation is there but also it’s difficult to click on the precise county - given that they broke down the data by county I’m assuming they want people to be able to see which county has how many cases__


Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)
* Considering color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose? 

    __I think NYT could’ve used state abbreviations and bolded them because it makes the already complicated-looking map even more messy. I think using red dots on neutral map background is a good way of highlighting the cases but because there are so many dots all over the place it made me a little dizzy__

* Type (1-5) 

    __3 for the reason explained above__


Objective: Creativity
* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you? 

    __This kind of map is more of a necessity than an option when it comes to such situations, so it obviously lacks the sense of creativity compared to other data pieces embedded in stories with specific angles, but overall I think it was a critical piece for all the coronavirus story series to follow so I’d give a 4__



<h1> Idea 2: COVID-19, name calling, and racism </h1>
<h4> This will be a story focusing on the racist attacks against Asian communities since the virus outbreak. There are so many nightmare stories happening right outside our doors ranging from verbal attacks and spitting at Asians on the street to stabbing a 3-year-old Asian child. There should be more mainstream media coverage on this issue to raise the awareness and this story in part is me contributing to the community I call home. The story will include recent racist attacks on Asians around the country, expert opinions on what effects such name calling can bring and WHO's explanation on naming pandemics. The data piece complementing the story could be either:

* compare the number of reported attacks since the pandemic outbreak and prior the outbreak with the similar time frame
* could be colour coding the number of reported attacks on a map. </h4>

Objective: Clarity and accuracy
* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. 

    __The headline is rather click-baity given the focus of the story is more on the historic aspect of racism against Asians, not the current news. I'd say 3.5__

* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent 

    __The story does not have a data visualization component and is not super dependent on data so I don't think I can rate it__

* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate 

    __The data the story used is from an Asian Pacific coalition so I'd assume it has more resources and interest in collecting these kind of data than any other organizations in this country -- giving a 4 for this__


Objective: Quality
* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.) 

    __I learned something new about the history of racism/oppression against Asians so I'd give a 3__

* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate) 

    __This is not a data story per se so this category doesn't fit__


Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)
* Considering color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose? 

    __The story did not include any graphics__

* Type (1-5) 

    __The story did not include any graphics although I've always disliked the font NBC digital uses for the time stamp and reporter's name at the very end. It's just too typewriter-ish and feels like it lacks seriousness__
